# ChainReaction

## What is Chain Reaction ?

It was a school project, we had to reprogram the Chain Reaction game and be able to :
- Play from 2 to 8 people
- Play on a board from 3x3 to 10x15
- Save and resume a game

For those who are not familiar with the Chain Reaction Game you can find an explanation here :

It is currently in french but feel free to use it or modify it as you need =P

Enjoy !
